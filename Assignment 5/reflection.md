Keeping data clean and accurate was one of the biggest obstacles I faced. 
Data preprocessing required cautious attention and a methodical methodology to deal with duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies. 
This stage emphasized the value of data preparation as the starting point for precise analysis.


Another significant difficulty was in creating and putting the JOIN and aggregate processes into practice.
Even though the practice of these procedures is fundamental, 
I found that precise attribute selection for JOIN and the right aggregation measures necessitate a thorough grasp of the data and its context.
This realization highlighted the significance of in-depth data research and subject expertise in creating efficient conversions.
As I think back on this project, I see some elements that I would handle differently in the future. 
Before beginning any transformations, I would first spend more time up front on extensive data exploration. 
I think I could choose the precise JOIN and aggregate procedures that would produce the most insightful results if I had a deeper understanding of the datasets and their subtleties.

In conclusion, this project has been a priceless learning opportunity that has really improved my ability to manipulate data, change it, and use Python to actually accomplish database operations.
